history
</h6>

<h5>
formed in early 2017, austyn benyak, zac breitbach + cody doman quickly got to writing songs that they wanted to hear—songs that were heavy, spacey, yet poppy at the same time. opting for a different approach from most bands in their scene, honeymoon hunkered down, perfected four songs + booked studio time at very tight recordings in pittsburgh; these are the songs that make up their ep 14:43, which draws from slowcore influences + more mainstream alternative rock. honeymoon released this ep + played their first show august 1 2017 at mahall’s 20 lanes in lakewood, ohio; this show gained the attention of local label bands of the dealer who offered to release a run of cassettes for the ep. the band stayed busy, playing shows around ohio and writing more songs. in november 2017, the band went back into the studio to record two more songs at superior sound recordings in cleveland with the intention to continue what they had started on the ep and break through to a larger audience.
